For shame deny that thou bearst love to any
Who for thy self art so unprovident
Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
But that thou none lovst is most evident
For thou art so possessed with murdrous hate
That gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire
O change thy thought that I may change my mind
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
Or to thy self at least kindhearted prove
  Make thee another self for love of me
  That beauty still may live in thine or thee

Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Of his selflove to stop posterity
Thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
  But if thou live remembered not to be
  Die single and thine image dies with thee

Who will believe my verse in time to come
If it were filled with your most high deserts
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts
If I could write the beauty of your eyes
And in fresh numbers number all your graces
The age to come would say this poet lies
Such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces
So should my papers yellowed with their age
Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue
And your true rights be termed a poets rage
And stretched metre of an antique song
  But were some child of yours alive that time
  You should live twice in it and in my rhyme
